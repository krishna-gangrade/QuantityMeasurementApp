# Quantity Measurement App – UC10 (Generic Quantity Class with Unit Interface)

### 📌 Overview

- This module refactors the previous category-specific Quantity classes into a single, generic `Quantity<U>` class that works with any measurement category implementing the `IMeasurable` interface.

- Restricts **unsupported arithmetic operations** on temperature with clear validation
- Refactors `IMeasurable` to allow **selective operation support** while keeping existing units unchanged

### ⚙️ UC14 – Key Implementation Points

* Introduced `TemperatureUnit` (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin) with non-linear conversion formulas.
* Refactored `IMeasurable` to add `default methods` for optional arithmetic support.
* Added **SupportsArithmetic** functional interface with lambda-based capability flags.
* Non-temperature units inherit default arithmetic support (**backwards compatible**).
* Temperature explicitly **disables arithmetic** (add, subtract, divide) via overrides.
* `Quantity` validates `operation support upfront` before performing arithmetic.
* Equality and conversion work uniformly via **base-unit normalisation**.
* Cross-category comparisons remain `prohibited and type-safe`.
* Unsupported operations fail fast with **clear UnsupportedOperationException** messages.
* All **UC1–UC13 tests pass unchanged**, ensuring non-breaking evolution.
