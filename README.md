# Quantity Measurement App – UC10 (Generic Quantity Class with Unit Interface)

### 📌 Overview

- This module refactors the previous category-specific Quantity classes into a single, generic `Quantity<U>` class that works with any measurement category implementing the `IMeasurable` interface.

### ⚙️ Key Implementation Points

- Uses a single generic class: `Quantity<U extends IMeasurable>`
- Holds private final fields: `value` and `unit` (immutable)
- `IMeasurable` interface standardises unit behaviour across categories
- Enums (`LengthUnit`, `WeightUnit`) implement `IMeasurable` and encapsulate conversion logic
- `equals()` compares base unit values using `Double.compare()` and validates unit types

# Quantity Measurement App - UC14 (Temperature Measurement with Selective Arithmetic Support)

### 📌 Overview

- UC14 extends the Quantity Measurement Application to support temperature measurements while respecting real-world arithmetic constraints.
- Unlike length, weight, and volume, temperature does not support full arithmetic.
- This use case refactors the IMeasurable interface to make arithmetic optional, enabling temperature units to support only equality and conversion while rejecting unsupported operations with clear errors.

### ⚙️ Use Case: UC14 (Temperature Measurement)

- Introduces **temperature measurement support** with unit conversion and equality
- Restricts **unsupported arithmetic operations** on temperature with clear validation
- Refactors `IMeasurable` to allow **selective operation support** while keeping existing units unchanged

### ⚙️ UC14 – Key Implementation Points

* Introduced `TemperatureUnit` (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin) with non-linear conversion formulas.
* Refactored `IMeasurable` to add `default methods` for optional arithmetic support.
* Added **SupportsArithmetic** functional interface with lambda-based capability flags.
* Non-temperature units inherit default arithmetic support (**backwards compatible**).
* Temperature explicitly **disables arithmetic** (add, subtract, divide) via overrides.
* `Quantity` validates `operation support upfront` before performing arithmetic.
* Equality and conversion work uniformly via **base-unit normalisation**.
* Cross-category comparisons remain `prohibited and type-safe`.
* Unsupported operations fail fast with **clear UnsupportedOperationException** messages.
* All **UC1–UC13 tests pass unchanged**, ensuring non-breaking evolution.
